# CHANGES AS OF April 03 2022 #

1) Added value: int l_max_len to struct. Represents the lenght of the longest line found in map.

2) Modified int **map to char **map in struct and changed the mallocs to callocs of appropriate size.
	This was done for easier read while drawing the map (we can use the NULL pointer and '\0' termination
	to exit the loops).

4) Floor and Ceiling colors are now read from map file and stored in struct at int colors[6] array. 
	Any diversion from the specific map format returns an error appropriately. Whitespace is ignored.

3) mlx window is now of variable size, based on map size (win_width = l_max_len * block width 
														  win_height =	lc * block_height).

4) Added a wall drawer that reads map array and draws wall blocks of x*y dimensions(modifiable) and of any
	rgb color. It also draws the character start position block at a different rgb color of choice.

5) Added the create_trgb function.It returns an int representing a color based on given transparency, red,
	green and blue values.

# NEXT STEP #
Implement character movement in the 2d plane (1st only horizontal/vertical)
Properly cast a single ray from character that stops upon hitting a wall, in the 2d plane.
